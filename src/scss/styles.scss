/*

Difference between @use and @import:

1. Global scope
===============
      @import scope may override the imported file's current scope.
      @use scope is isolated to the current file.

2. Load order
=============
      @import: With @import, the order of imported files matters.
      Files imported later can override styles defined in earlier imports.


      @use: @use ensures a more predictable and modular structure.
      You can import files in any order, and there's less risk of style conflicts between files.

3. Deprecation
==============

      @import: It's considered a legacy feature and is deprecated in favor of @use.
      @use: This is the recommended way to manage stylesheets and modules in modern SASS projects.
